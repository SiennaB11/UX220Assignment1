# Hobbies
- I believe that my hobbies will remain the same. I will still play volleyball if there is a league. You have to find a way to stay active and have fun. check and check.
- I will have continued taking photos. Maybe expanding what I take photos of us also never changing my roots and continuing to take photos of all of the flowers that catch my eye.
- Music and musicals will always be a part of my life. I may have the freedom without classes to go and see more musicals. yay!
- As well as hanging out with friends and family. Never forgetting those who got me to this point of my life.
