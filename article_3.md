# Professional
- By now I will have definitely NOT decided what career I want. Writing...yes. Journalism or poems or fiction, no idea. the writing profession is usually no a steady thing it takes a very good writer for that to happen. Who knows maybe that is me. Maybe not.
- I hope that I don't ever choose between them all and writing makes me happy and the freedom to do all three is exactly what I want.
- There are so many jobs in the writing field. The options are limitless. People always say that journalism is dying and there are so many people who don't make it as authors.
- I have five years to prove this assignment to be true.
