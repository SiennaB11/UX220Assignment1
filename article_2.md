# Travel
- With school finally being done, even if I decided to go back to school to get a more specific writing degree I would still be done school with a year or two to travel.
- Hopefully by now I have figured out how to get on a plane without being overly anxious and getting motion sick.
- I would have the chance to visit the countries in Europe that I have always wanted to visit. I have been saving money up for a while for this. The adventures to Europe. the road trips across Canada with friends.
- I love traveling but they didn't need to be big adventures there are so many places in Canada that I want to visit as well.
- Plus planes kind of scare me.
