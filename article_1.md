# Family

- Five years from now I will be 25 years old, probably engaged, possibly married. I will hopefully have my own place, or rather our own place, but who knows in this economy.
- I think that I would stay close to home, close maybe in the sense as in the same province.
- My parents will probably finally be empty nesters and get to travel and take more time off work.
- My sister and I will hopefully still be close. Completely different lives but always a part of each other.Â
